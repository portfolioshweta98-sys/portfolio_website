# Adding Project Images

To add images for the new projects:

1. **For CheckMe-AI/EvalMate (Project 4):**
   - Save your screenshot as: `public/project-4-evalmate.jpg`
   - Or use: `public/project-4-evalmate.png`
   - The image should show the split-screen interface with PDF viewer and evaluation results

2. **For HC3 Adversarial Analysis (Project 5):**
   - Save your flowchart diagram as: `public/project-5-hc3.jpg`
   - Or use: `public/project-5-hc3.png`
   - The image should show the pipeline flowchart from HC3 data ingestion to adversarial evaluation

**Quick Steps:**
1. Take screenshots/save images of your projects
2. Name them exactly as shown above
3. Place them in the `public/` folder
4. The images will automatically appear on your portfolio

**Alternative:** If you want to use existing images temporarily, you can change the image paths in `data/projects.ts` to:
- `/research.png` for HC3 project
- `/project 3.jpg` for EvalMate project
