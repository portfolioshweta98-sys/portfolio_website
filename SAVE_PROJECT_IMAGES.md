# How to Save Project Images

## Step 1: Save the Images

Save the two images you showed me with these exact names in the `public/` folder:

1. **CheckMe-AI/EvalMate screenshot** → Save as: `public/project-4-evalmate.jpg`
   - This is the split-screen interface showing PDF viewer and evaluation results

2. **HC3 Adversarial Analysis flowchart** → Save as: `public/project-5-hc3.jpg`
   - This is the pipeline flowchart from HC3 data ingestion to adversarial evaluation

## Step 2: Verify

After saving, check that these files exist:
- `public/project-4-evalmate.jpg`
- `public/project-5-hc3.jpg`

## Step 3: Done!

The image paths are already updated in `data/projects.ts`. Once you add the images to the `public/` folder, they will automatically appear on your portfolio after deployment.

**Note:** You can use `.png` instead of `.jpg` if you prefer - just update the paths in `data/projects.ts` accordingly.
