# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Your Project Images

Your portfolio is currently showing placeholder images for the new projects. To fix this:

## Step 1: Save Your Images

Take the two screenshots you showed me and save them in the `public/` folder with these EXACT names:

1. **CheckMe-AI/EvalMate screenshot** (the split-screen interface):
   - Save as: `public/project-4-evalmate.jpg`
   - Or: `public/project-4-evalmate.png`

2. **HC3 Adversarial Analysis flowchart** (the pipeline diagram):
   - Save as: `public/project-5-hc3.jpg`
   - Or: `public/project-5-hc3.png`

## Step 2: Update the Code

After saving the images, I'll update `data/projects.ts` to use:
- `/project-4-evalmate.jpg` for CheckMe-AI
- `/project-5-hc3.jpg` for HC3

## Current Status

Right now using temporary images:
- CheckMe-AI: `/project 2.jpg` (temporary)
- HC3: `/research.png` (temporary)

**Once you add the images to the public folder, let me know and I'll update the paths!**
